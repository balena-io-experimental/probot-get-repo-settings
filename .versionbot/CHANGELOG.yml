        If the integration id is a GHA and it hasn't run recently,
        the ruleset will fail to be applied.

    - subject: Default to GitHub Actions integration ID when app_id is null
      hash: a382925ea0b4280cc1d503d9ef8430ffd322fb91
      body: |
        On some repositories the current branch protections are returning
        null for the app_id, possibly because the checks have not run recently.

        For now we can default to the GHA integration ID and fix it
        later if there is a mismatch and the check is from another source.
