    - subject: Switch to ES modules and use octokit directly
      hash: e65ef971588259d8f4bbe5a506709a2a4d3dafb4
      body: |
        Probot was struggling to use octokit with ESM
        modules but we didn't really need the extra
        framework of probot anyway.

      body: |
        On some repositories the current branch protections are returning
        null for the app_id, possibly because the checks have not run recently.

        For now we can default to the GHA integration ID and fix it
        later if there is a mismatch and the check is from another source.
